        h3#fix-bugs I want to fix/squash some bugs
        p.preWrap
          | Fixing bugs is an integral part of maintaining Mathbook. If it's your first time, we recommend starting off with the smaller bugs. 
          | If and when you get comfortable fixing bugs and making changes to the source code, you are more than welcome to making the jump 
          | towards squashing bigger bugs.

        h3#write-docs I want to write some documentation
        p.preWrap
          | Documentation is very important for new and existing contributors of Mathbook because it serves as a reference for understanding how Mathbook works under the hood.
          | Writing documentation requires knowledge of the inner workings of Mathbook and the reasoning behind the decisions made in the architecture and source code.
        p.preWrap
          | The documentation for Mathbook lives 
          a(href="https://github.com/mathbook-io/mathbook/wiki" target="_blank") here
        p.preWrap
          | We recommend reading through some parts of the docs to get an idea of what's needed to contribute to the docs, ie) formatting, providing examples and 
          | maybe even referencing some part of the source code

        h3#write-tests I want to contribute by writing some tests
        p.preWrap
          | Testing is important to the overall success of Mathbook and all software projects in general. Tests give us visibility into the effects of the changes 
          | we make into the source code that might be due to a simple refactor or implementing a new feature. 
          | Always remember, 
          strong if you find a bug, then that means you missed a test scenario.

        p.preWrap
          | For Mathbook, the testing framework we use is 
          a(href="http://chaijs.com/" target="_blank") Chai 
          | and our test runner is 
          a(href="https://mochajs.org/" target="_blank") Mocha
          | . We also use 
          a(href="http://sinonjs.org/" target="_blank") Sinon
          |  for stubbing/mocking and setting up spies. 
          | Check out the tests folder in the 
          a(href="https://github.com/mathbook-io/mathbook/tree/develop/tests" target="_blank") source code 
          | to get an idea of how we structure our test suites. 
        p.preWrap You can also check out the 
          a(href="https://github.com/mathbook-io/mathbook/wiki/Testing-Documentation" target="_blank") documentation
          |  to learn about the reasoning behind the different types of tests that we write.

        h3#feedback I want to provide some feedback
        p.preWrap
          | Your feedback is always welcome. Do you have an idea for a new feature or think that some functionality could be improved, let us know.
          | You can create an issue on GitHub and tag the issue with the proper tag that reflects your feedback (we have a bunch of tags, pick one that best represents your feedback). 
        p
          a(href="https://github.com/mathbook-io/mathbook/issues" target="_blank") Click here to go the issues page and provide some feedback
          span(class="help has-text-grey") Note: You will need to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one to create an issue.
